# SpACE_Data_Clustering

In simple terms, the project is a software system that will take data and do clustering.
More specifically, the project is a Windows-based, graphical user interface (GUI) software
system that will allow a user to import data and perform the K-means and DBSCAN algorithms to
cluster the data.
The project will use data from NASA’s ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment
on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) Spectral Library – Version 1.0. The library contains infrared
spectra for thousands of substances measured in a variety of different laboratories. The data
is preprocessed, then two normalization techniques may be applied prior to clustering. The
option to select subsets of the data and get results from the intermediary phases of analysis
is included. After clustering, the user may view a 2D or 3D plot of either algorithm's results, and save the results.

Below is a screenshot after analyzing a subset of ECOSTRESS data.
